# AI Employee Task Assignment System

An AI-powered system for optimal task allocation among employees based on skills, availability, and performance metrics.

## Features

- **Intelligent Task Matching**: Automatically matches tasks to the most suitable employees based on required skills, current availability, and historical preferences
- **Employee Status Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of employee availability with color-coded indicators (ðŸŸ¢Free, ðŸŸ¡Partially Working, ðŸ”´Fully Occupied, âœ…Completed)
- **Performance Analytics**: Tracks employee performance metrics including task completion rates, priority handling, and on-time delivery
- **Preference Learning**: Learns from past task assignments to improve future matching based on employee performance and preferences
